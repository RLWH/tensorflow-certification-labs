        "1. Just get the convoluation layers of one model\n",

        "3. Train just the dense network\n",
        "4. Evaluate the results\n",
        "\n",
        "Doing this will allow us to save time building our application because we will essentially skip weeks of training time of very deep networks. We will just use the features it has learned and tweak it for the dataset. "
